# How it works

1) **Request discussion** → short intake  
2) **Scoping call** → confirm fit, timeline, deliverables  
3) **Written proposal** → fixed scope and milestones  
4) **Delivery** → draft + figures/tables + references + evidence trail

## Research integrity & ethics
- Output is **traceable to sources** (references + evidence trail).
- **No plagiarism**; all text is original synthesis.
- Authorship and acknowledgements follow **ICMJE/COPE-aligned norms** (authorship only when criteria are met).
- Confidentiality by default; data handling and deletion schedule agreed at kickoff.

## What this is not
- Not a public SaaS platform.
- Not “guaranteed publication.”
- Not undisclosed ghost authorship.
