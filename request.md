# Request a discussion

Access is consultation-gated to keep work rigorous and confidential.

**Email:** `CONTACT_EMAIL_HERE`  
**Intake form:** `PASTE_FORM_LINK_HERE`

## What happens next
1) I review your intake (topic, goal, deadline, constraints).  
2) If it’s a fit, we schedule a short scoping call.  
3) You receive a written proposal with scope, milestones, and deliverables.

## What to include (copy/paste is fine)
- Topic/field and the intended output (review, grant, technical report, etc.)
- Deadline and any internal milestones
- Whether you have seed papers, an existing library, or a draft manuscript
- Preferred synthesis type (narrative, scoping-style, structured review)
- Any constraints (databases, languages, confidentiality)
